PC/SC wrapper classes for .NET, written in C#. The package contains classes to 
access the Personal Computer/Smart Card Resource Manager using the system's 
native PC/SC API. Implements partial ISO7816 support.
The library is written to run on both, Windows and Unix (Linux with Mono using
PCSC Lite).

Tested on:
==========

- Windows (winscard.dll) 
  * Windows 8 (64bit) Professional

- Linux (PC/SC lite)
  * Ubuntu Linux 13.04 (64bit)
  * Ubuntu Linux 13.04 (32bit)

Have a look into the Examples directory. Please be aware that I am still not 
happy with the class design, methods, parameter names etc. Slight changes 
might appear :-) Check the Changelog file.
