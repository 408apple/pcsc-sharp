PC/SC wrapper classes for .NET, written in C#. 
Author: Daniel Mueller

Tested on 

- Windows (winscard.dll) 
  * Windows 7 64bit Professional

- Linux (PC/SC lite)
  * Ubuntu 12.10 64bit edition

Have a look into the Examples directory. Please be aware that I am still not 
happy with the class design, methods, parameter names etc. Slight changes 
might appear :-) Check the CHANGELOG file.
